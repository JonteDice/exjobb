To run this project I have to take these necessary steps to ensure it works.

Extra requirements:
1. Make sure python is installed. My current python version is 3.12.0.
2. This project is run in windows, if you are using another operating system and it's not working, you may need additional installments unique to your OS.
3. The website used is firefox. Any other browser should work however if a problem is encountered, you might need to switch to firefox.

Start website (windows):
1. Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope Process
2.  .\env\Scripts\activate
3. cd .\my_site\
4. python manage.py runserver

Extensions:
Since I cant run sqlite3 db.sqlite on this project and I've not been able to hone in on the problem. I use the extension "SQLite Viewer" if I need to look inside the database.
